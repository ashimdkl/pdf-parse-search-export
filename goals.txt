ok so i want to completely change this structure and this is how i want to do it:

user uploads doc files (can be any length, up to 100s of pages long) (microsoft word)

our goal: find the sequence # using the facility ID we get from searching in each page of the docx file, each page can have its own.

example, page 1 somewhere might have:

FPB0021                              PACIFICORP                              PAGE     1
2024-04-23                  CORRECTION TRACKING REPORT                        9.30.24

State=OR  District=132              Lati=N  42.16588500 Long=W 123.63832700

>068038/00            11/028               PPLT
 01339008.0           221761               PPLD
    JU=TELCO    1997-08-01 0095 FRONTIER (CITIZENS)(OR)(T)


Note the : < 01339008.0 , 221761> and then we store that in a variable called facID = 01339008.0221761.
store that as <page1, 01339008.0221761>.


we go through and locally store somewhere what each page's ID is, example:

page 1, facID
page 2, facID
page 3, facID
page last, facID


then use that facID value to find the sequence # from the data.xlsx which has a bunch of facID's and sequence #'s assosciated with it.

ex: (Data.xlsx)
Sequence	Facility ID
1010	01339008.0221700
1020	01339008.0221761  // for <01339008.0221761 like above, the sequence is 1020>
1030	01339008.0221703
1040	01339008.0221702
1050	01339008.0221701

then, for every page, we will output it into a folder which will change the names of the files and the format of the files.
we will output like this.
- output
  - page1_sequence1020_01339008.0221761.pdf and page 1 will output like that
  - page2_sequencexxxx_xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxx.pdf and page 2 will output like that

and we will do that and output x amount of files in which x is the # of pages in the docx page.

so pretty much, to fix some of the issues we were having, 
store the page#, facID assosciated with that page of the docx and do that by parsing it.
then we use that facID to find the sequence from the data.xlsx,

Then output it into a folder with all of those seperate instances of each page each with its own unique name corresponding with the page#, seq id, fac id
